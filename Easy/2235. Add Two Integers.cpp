Given two integers num1 and num2, return the sum of the two integers.

 

Example 1:

Input: num1 = 12, num2 = 5
Output: 17
Explanation: num1 is 12, num2 is 5, and their sum is 12 + 5 = 17, so 17 is returned.

Example 2:

Input: num1 = -10, num2 = 4
Output: -6
Explanation: num1 + num2 = -6, so -6 is returned.

 

Constraints:

    -100 <= num1, num2 <= 100
