Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), return the minimum absolute difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.

 

Example 1:

Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3]
Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: root = [1,0,48,null,null,12,49]
Output: 1

 

Constraints:

    The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 104].
    0 <= Node.val <= 105

How many of you came here today after solving 'Minimum Distance between Nodes' and submitted the same solution just to increase your questions count ?

We are supposed to find the minimum absolute difference between any two nodes. If the absolute difference is desired, why for certain test cases the expected results are negative numbers? Also, if I understand correctly, the difference can be taken between any two nodes. However, all the solutions I have seen are comparing inorder nieghbors. I am confused...

I think temperature of June in Gurgaon is inversely proportional to difficulty level of leetcode challenge.

If this question is same as Minimum Distance Between BST Nodes then why keep both of them?

Hint

Find the difference between the minimum node on the right and the maximum node on the left

This is the same as finding the minimum difference between adjacent elements in a sorted array of node values
